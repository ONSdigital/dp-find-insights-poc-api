## Queries

We can use the integration tests as a crib for the parameters (eg. rows, cols etc.)

https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-find-insights-poc-api/blob/develop/inttests/main.go

"rows" are one, more or ranges of ONS geographical codes (eg. E01000001). LSOA
and LAD are currently available.  These can be specified in the "geocode"
parameter as well.

"cols" are the long NOMIS category codes from the NOMIS Bulk system (eg. QS118EW0011). The QS
(quick statistics are available).

ÔÅ± Warning these are different NOMIS codes to those used in the NOMIS API. There
is an extra 0 in these NOMIS codes and 0001 refers to total rather than the
first metric.

## Ranges

eg. QS118EW0001...QS118EW0011
eg. E01001111...E01001211

## Geo Queries

These support PostGIS geography types in the database which allow things like
long,lat to be used in bounding box queries etc. which resemble the "skinny"
ones.

eg. bbox=-0.370947083400182,51.3624781092781,0.17687729439413147,51.67377813346024
